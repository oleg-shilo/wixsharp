    <description>Wix# is a framework for building a complete MSI or WiX source code by using build script files written with the C# syntax.
The package contains Wix# binaries, code sample and custom MSBuild target (to be merged with VS project and trigger building MSI during the project compilation).

If you need only Wix# binaries you may want to use WixSharp.bin package instead.

In order to use this package you need have WiX Toolset installed.
The package is tested against WIX (Windows Installer Xml) Toolset v3.10 (v3.10.2103.0)</description>

- #1887 QOL request: batch files together into fewer signtool invocations

- Added: FileAssociation.IconFile property for auto-registering icon files (curtsey of dand-oss)
  When IconFile is set to a path, WixSharp automatically registers an Icon element and uses its ID for the file association.
  This simplifies icon setup for non-advertised file associations where the Icon attribute must be an Icon Id rather than a file path.
- Added: InstalledFileAction resolves file key by name if ID not found
  When the Key property doesn't match an exact file ID, WixSharp now searches for a file by name (case-insensitive) and uses its ID.
  This allows using simple filenames like "MyApp.exe" instead of having to specify the WiX-generated file ID.
  If multiple files match the name, an exception is thrown with a clear error message listing the matching files.
